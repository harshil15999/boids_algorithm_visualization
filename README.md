## what is boids algorithm?

Boids is an artificial life simulation originally developed by Craig Reynolds. The aim of the simulation was to replicate the behavior of flocks of birds. Instead of controlling the interactions of an entire flock, however, the Boids simulation only specifies the behavior of each individual bird. With only a few simple rules, the program manages to generate a result that is complex and realistic enough to be used as a framework for computer graphics applications such as computer generated behavioral animation in motion picture films.
